    Imagine houses are all along the same y dimension for simplicity. Consider 4
    houses, one at x=0, x=5, x=6, and x=10. Using the greedy strategy, the
    houses at x=5 and x=6 will be matched first, then the remaining houses. This
    total cost will be 1 + 10 = 11. An optimal match could be found by matching
    x=0 and x=5 followed by x=6 with x=10 for a total cost of 5 + 4 = 9.
